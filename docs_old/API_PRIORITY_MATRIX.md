- **10% effort** on P3 components (Weeks 7-8)

### **Risk Management:**
- **Focus on P0 first** - These are non-negotiable for launch
- **Parallel development** - Frontend and backend teams work simultaneously
- **Incremental testing** - Test each component as it's completed
- **Fallback plans** - Have manual processes ready for any delayed components

### **Success Metrics:**
- **P0 Completion:** 100% by Week 2
- **P1 Completion:** 100% by Week 4
- **P2 Completion:** 80% by Week 6
